 * Markup Notice

 * This template can be overridden by copying it to yourtheme/templates/side-cart-woocommerce/global/markup-notice.php.
 *
 * HOWEVER, on occasion we will need to update template files and you
 * (the theme developer) will need to copy the new files to your theme to
 * maintain compatibility. We try to do this as little as possible, but it does
 * happen.
 * @see     https://docs.xootix.com/side-cart-woocommerce/
